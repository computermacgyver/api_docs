# Getting Started

Change.org provides a free API that empowers anyone to run their campaigns
anywhere. To get started, you will need an API key and secret token. While most API
requests do not require a petition authorization key, you'll need one if
you are making requests that add or update a resource (e.g. adding signatures
to a petition).
