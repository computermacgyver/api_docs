# Getting Started

Change.org provides a free API that empowers anyone to run their campaigns
anywhere. To get started, you will need an API key and secret. While most API
requests do not require a petition authorization key, you'll need one for
requests that add or update a resource (e.g. adding signatures to a petition).

## Obtain an API Key and Secret Token

More details coming soon.

## Rate Limits

A maximum of 50,000 requests per day using the same API key are allowed. A
maximum of 10,000 requests per day using the same petition authorization key are
allowed.

Upon special request and coordination with Change.org, these limits may be
lifted.
